== Villanelle named 'A House' ==
This is a poem about a house
and the hole in the wall,
hiding the smallest mouse 


Where the tree is in its path,
you are the smallest mouse in the wall.
But I say,
I have more thoughts for you than for the hole in the wall.
Do not let me tell you how you were to die in that one thing,
that I will not return to you.
And when the fire at last burned,
you stood as the first to die
in this room,
and the fire at last burned,
to which, you are the smallest mouse
in the wall.
But to us this death is the final sacrifice,
and to you I am your last hope.
