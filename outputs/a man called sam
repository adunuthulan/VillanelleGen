== Villanelle named 'A Man Called Sam' ==
This is a poem about a man called sam.
With the little I know,
I tell you what I've heard.


He lies near my bed
A mottled man who likes to play the violin.
So I do not ask questions.
I tell you what I know.


His name is 'A Man Called Sam'.
With the little I know,
I tell you what I've heard.
He's got something I cannot explain.
But if I can,
I must do it.


The time I did come was great
Slim-legged.
The weather was cool, with the sun.
When he was young he'd come to visit.
When I lived my life to him,
I took no notice.


To those who'd come to visit,
You did not learn anything;
But if I could,
I would find it.


When it dawned upon me that they were all dead,
To the last I heard nothing
I put my lips to sleep in shame
And told all my relatives that my death would be my last.


I cannot keep up to the present,
Nor care to keep myself awake.
And by this time I could never do the things which I've said to you.
You should listen to the words I hear,
and make my way from this side
To the house which will keep him safe.
He is a good man of the mind.
