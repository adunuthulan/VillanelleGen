== Villanelle named 'Starry Night' ==
This is a poem about the night,
starry swirls over canvas,
and dreams painted in the light.


The dark is as dark and as vivid
when I walk on the night.


In the night I have seen in your eyes.
As in your eyes I was alone.
A dream, a dream I dreamt:
like the way you feel when you dream I saw the great ocean at rest.


I heard the soft voice of you at my door.
And as a ghost I felt the cold,
like a stranger who leaves
in the dark with no one to wake me.


On the other side of the ocean you were the sun:
like the moon rising above
the shore, the waves that came to sea.
A dream that I saw in your eyes.
Like the way you felt when you dream I saw the great ocean at rest.


I saw the soft voice of you at my door.
Like a ghost you saw me walking in the dark with no one to wake me.


Your eyes are as white as the moon rising above the shore.
But as a ghost I saw in your eyes.
Like the way you felt when you dream I saw the great ocean at rest.
